Since I have interest in the financial markets, I did a Crypto Currency tracker. The applications collects data such as Total Cryptocurrencies, Total Exchanges, Markets Cap, 24h volume and total markets. It also desplays the top 10 Crypto Currencies in the world with extension to display more of them and search for your favorite one.

It also has a News section that display the latest news in about the currencies. It communicates via an API that fetch the correct data!

This project contains the following techstack: 

* ReactJS
* Antd
* Millify
* React Router

If you want to try it out, clone it down and do a npm install in the root folder. Then you can go with npm start and the local server should start :-)
